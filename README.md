#alzheimer_classification

To predict on images and categorize whether the person has alzheimer, mild cognitively or normal.

Alzheimer is a neuro-degenerative disease where a person loses the ability to do day-to-day activities. It affects the person's memories and loses control over their lives. It becomes apparent that early diagnosis of the disease is essential to keep it in check. But the lack of medical image data is one of the roadblocks. And handling of medical images is itself difficult. The Medical imaging used for medical images is MRI, PET fMRI etc.

ADNI has one of the largest respository of ALzheimer's disease(AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment(MCI) and Control normal(CN) patients details.

Various Methods has been used to solve the problem of classification including Machine learning, deep learning and even traditional method.

In this project, pre-trained model dense-net112 is being used to solve the problem. The no. of classes is three namely 1: Alzheimer 2: MCI 3: CN.
